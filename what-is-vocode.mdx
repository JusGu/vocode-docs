## Problem: Building conversational voice AI is hard

To build a conversational voice interface, you have to orchestrate several pieces –
speech recognition, AI/NLU for generating responses, and speech synthesis –
in real time while managing the asynchronous and imperfect nature of human conversation.

The Vocode SDK arms developers with out-of-the-box tools that dramatically reduces the complexity
of building their own voice stack. It provides:

- Back-and-forth conversation orchestraction as a service
- One place for all of your integrations and the ability to swap out providers in a single line of code
- Cross-platform compatibility (web, mobile, telephony)

In essence, Vocode SDK focuses on all the voice and conversation related pieces so that developers
can focus on their core product.
