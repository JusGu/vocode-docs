## Overview

The idea behind creating your own AI agent is allowing complete control over the AI
layer of your application. Users will be responsible for implementing either a
`RESTfulAgent` or a `WebSocketAgent` that the Vocode backend will use to generate responses.

Both are just as easy to set up using the abstractions provided by the Vocode SDK. Note that the
websocket implementation will have a marginally faster performance due to the decreased overhead
for each query to the agent.

## RESTful Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `RESTfulAgent` that just responds with the same input that
it receives.

```python
from vocode.user_implemented_agent.restful_agent import RESTfulAgent

class YourAgent(RESTfulAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str) -> str:
        return input ## your response logic goes here
```

## WebSocket Implementation

Here is an example implementation of a `WebSocketAgent` that just responds with the same input that
it receives.

```python
from vocode.user_implemented_agent.websocket_agent import WebSocketAgent

class YourAgent(WebSocketAgent):

    # input: the transcript from the Conversation that the agent must respond to
    async def respond(self, input: str) -> str:
        return input ## your response logic goes here
```
